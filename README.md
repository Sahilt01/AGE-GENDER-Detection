GENDER AND AGE DETECTION WITH DATA SCIENCE
Utilized Python and computer vision techniques to design and implement AI models for predicting gender and age from facial images. 
The models were trained and tested on datasets using a linear kernel approach to classify gender and detect age. And increased dataset size to enhance accuracy and refining the algorithms for better performance.
